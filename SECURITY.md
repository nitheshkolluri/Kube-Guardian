## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of KubeGuardian seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

**Please do not open a public issue.**

Instead, please send an email to security@kubeguardian.io (mock email for template) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for addressing the issue.

We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it. We will credit you for your discovery in our security advisories ensuring you get the proper recognition for your contribution.
